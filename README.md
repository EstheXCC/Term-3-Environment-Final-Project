# Environments Final Project 2 Description:
This game design is an Idea that I came up with in the Environments class during 
Term 2. This Term, my team and I worked on the game project 'Flow'. First of all, I 
think the teamwork as collaborative projects is mainly for the Big Show, but the Final 
Project is feedback on my own learning this semester, and second, I think my 
contribution to the code part in the team project is very small, I am afraid This will 
affect my score. For the above reasons, I made another project of my own. I've 
always loved my previous Idea, so I decided to bring it to life this semester. But I 
want to do a personal project on the premise of ensuring that our group's project is 
completed on time before the Big Show, so my time is limited, and the final effect is 
a little bit gap from my original idea, but I want to just use this project to show my 
coding skills and learning outcomes in this term.

# Game Story Background
The story takes place in the kitchen of 
a house, in the thick dusty mezzanine, 
a little mouse is born, which is 
carefully bred by the mother mouse. 
Time flies, and now it has reached the 
age to live alone without its mother. It 
has to go through various tests in the 
kitchen. During this process, it will 
experience various dangers and 
opportunities to obtain food. I hope the 
little mouse can go smoothly. Through 
many difficulties and then grow up 
smoothly.
